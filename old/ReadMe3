## 📘 Finova Financial Calculation Engine (MVP)

This repository contains the **deterministic financial engine** for the Finova B2B2C wealth-assistant widget.

It provides:

* Required monthly savings calculation
* Behavioral feasibility status
* Realism analysis vs. income
* Horizon classification
* Basic completion time prediction
* Friendly natural-language explanation

This engine is designed to be deployed on **Cloud Run** (Python API) as part of the Finova MVP stack.

## 🚀 Features

### ✔️ Required Monthly Saving

Accurate, deterministic, auditable.

### ✔️ Feasibility Classification

* `on_track_comfortable`
* `on_track_tight`
* `behind`
* `unknown`

### ✔️ Realism vs Income

* `realistic`
* `very_hard`
* `unrealistic`

### ✔️ Prediction (MVP)

Simple projection based on average savings.

### ✔️ Natural-Language Narrative

Human-friendly, explainable guidance.

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/finova-financial-engine.git
cd finova-financial-engine
```

Create virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Running the API Locally

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Then visit:

👉 `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` (Swagger UI)

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

This will run the automated unit tests including:

* zero-savings scenario
* unrealistic goal vs income
* comfortable on-track scenario

# 🔥 3. OPTIONAL: Add CI (Automatic Test Running)

If you want GitHub to automatically run your tests on every push:

Create this folder + file:

```
.github/workflows/python-tests.yml
```

Content:

```yaml
name: Run Engine Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python 3.11
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: "3.11"

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest
```

🔥 This makes GitHub run your engine tests automatically on every commit.

---

# 🚀 4. OPTIONAL: Add an Example Curl Test (for Vanessa & Dalanda)

Put this inside README under “Examples”:

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/calculate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "target_amount": 5000,
        "months_to_target": 12,
        "avg_monthly_saving": 300,
        "monthly_income": 2500,
        "current_progress": 0
      }'
```

# 🎯 Next Action Options for You

Tell me what you want to do next, I can guide you:

### A. **Clean up the repo**

### B. **Add advanced tests** (edge cases, heavy cases, extreme math)

### C. **Add a full behavior simulation test using your mock transactions**

### D. **Deploy this API to Cloud Run** (so the team can call it via internet)

### E. **Add authentication (Firebase / API key)**

### F. **Write the ML part (K-means segmentation)**

### G. **Create the recommendation engine next**

Just tell me **A / B / C / D / E / F / G** and I continue.
