This repository contains the deterministic financial engine for the Finova B2B2C wealth-assistant widget.

It provides:

Required monthly savings calculation

Behavioral feasibility status

Realism analysis vs. income

Horizon classification

Basic completion time prediction

Friendly natural-language explanation

This engine is designed to be deployed on Cloud Run (Python API) as part of the Finova MVP stack.

🚀 Features
✔️ Required Monthly Saving

Accurate, deterministic, auditable.

✔️ Feasibility Classification

on_track_comfortable

on_track_tight

behind

unknown

✔️ Realism vs Income

realistic

unrealistic

✔️ Prediction (MVP)

Simple projection based on average savings.

✔️ Natural-Language Narrative

Human-friendly, explainable guidance.
